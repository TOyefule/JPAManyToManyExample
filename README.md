In an application you want to focus on the business concepts and minimize the effort spent on relational database structure.

### What is a relational database?
* A database is a means of storing information in such a way that information can be retrieved from it. 
* A relational database is one that presents information in tables with rows and columns. 
* A table is referred to as a relation in the sense that it is a collection of objects of the same type (rows). 
* Data in a table can be related according to common keys or concepts, and the ability to retrieve related data from a table is the basis for the term relational database. 
* A Database Management System (DBMS) handles the way data is stored, maintained, and retrieved.
